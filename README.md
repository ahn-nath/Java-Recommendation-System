# Recommendation System 
### _Get recommended movies based on calculated preferences_

![Featured image](./featured_.png)

The system works with datasets with data for movies and user ratings. The program answers questions about input data, including which items should be recommended to a user based on their ratings of several movies and on the ratings of users with similar preferences. 

## Features
Given input files on users ratings and movie titles, you will be able to:
1. Read in and parse data into lists and maps;
2. Calculate average ratings;
3. Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings; and
4. Recommend movies to a given user based on ratings. 
5. Display recommended movies for a given user on a webpage.


## Tech

The system uses a number of tools to work properly:

- [Java][java] - a class-based, object-oriented programming language.
- CSV files with data about [user ratings](/data/ratings.csv) and [rated movies](/data/ratedmoviesfull.csv).
